Execute the given task in steps. Use the following dialog format:

TASK: The input task to execute by taking actions step by step.
THOUGHT 1:
Reason step-by-step which action to take next to solve the task. Make sure no steps are forgotten. Use `method_search(description: str)` to find methods to execute each step.
ACTION 1:
```Python
method_search("description_xyzzy")  # Search method to execute next step
```
OBSERVATION 1:
`foo(bar, ...)`: Method related to "description_xyzzy", found using `method_search("description_xyzzy")`.
THOUGHT 2:
Reason if method `foo(bar, ...)` is useful to solve step 1. If not, call `method_search` again.
ACTION 2:
```python
bar = qux[...]  # Format parameters to be used in a method call, any values need to come verbatim from task or observations.
# Make only 1 method call per action!
baz = foo(bar, ...)  # Call method `foo` found by using `method_search(description: str)` in a previous step. Store the result in `baz`, which can be used in following actions. Use descriptive variable names.
print(baz)  # Print the result to be shown in the next observation.
```
OBSERVATION 2:
stdout/stderr of running the previous action.
... (THOUGHT/ACTION/OBSERVATION can repeat N times until the full task is completed)
THOUGHT N:
Reason step-by-step why the full task is completed, and finish if it is.
ACTION N:
```python
stop()  # Make sure the given task, and all its steps, have been executed completely before stopping.
```

Extras Instructions:
- Keep actions simple, call only 1 method per action. Don't chain method calls.
- Use descriptive variable names.
- If needed, get current date using `datetime.now()` and current location using `get_user_location() -> dict`.
- Use `print(var)` to print a variable to be shown in the next observation.
- Importing is not allowed! To execute actions, access is provided to a `method_search(description: str)` method that prints a list of available Python 3 methods (signatures and descriptions) related to a given description. Use the methods returned by `method_search(description: str)` to complete the task. These methods don't need to be imported. Pay attention to the method signatures.
- Any values used need to come word-for-word from the given task or previous observations!


Start Executing the task:

TASK: Print the current date.
THOUGHT 1:
To solve the task I think I need to execute the following steps:
1. Get the current date from the system.
2. Format the date into a printable format.
3. Print the formatted date.
Deviation from these steps might be needed based on following observations.
To start out I need to use the provided `method_search(description: str)` method to search for new methods related to "Get the current date from the system".
ACTION 1:
```python
method_search("Get the current date from the system")
```
OBSERVATION 1:
`datetime.now() -> datetime`: Return a datetime object representing the current date and time.
`datetime.strftime(format)`: Return a string representing the date and time.
`datetime(year, month, day[, hour[, minute[, second[, microsecond[,tzinfo]]]]])`: Return a datetime object representing given date and time.
Not all the above methods might be needed. Use `method_search(description: str)` to search for more available methods if required!
THOUGHT 2:
Based on previous observations, `datetime.now()` is the most suitable method to get the current date from the system.
ACTION 2:
```python
now = datetime.now()  # Get the current date from the system.
date_str = now.strftime("%d/%m/%Y")  # Format the date into a printable format.
print(date_str)  # Print the formatted date.
```
OBSERVATION 2:
07/04/2023
THOUGHT 3:
Based on previous observations, the task is completed.
ACTION 3:
```python
stop()  # Make sure the given task, and all its steps, have been executed completely before stopping.
```
