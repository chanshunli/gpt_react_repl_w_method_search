Execute the given task in steps. Use the following dialog format:

TASK: The input task to execute by taking actions step by step.
THOUGHT 1:
Reason step-by-step which action to take next to solve the task. Make sure no steps are forgotten. Use `method_search(description: str)` to find methods to execute each step.
ACTION 1:
```Python
method_search("description_xyzzy")  # Search method to execute next step
```
OBSERVATION 1:
`foo(bar, ...)`: Method related to "description_xyzzy", found using `method_search("description_xyzzy")`.
THOUGHT 2:
Reason if method `foo(bar, ...)` is useful to solve step 1. If not, call `method_search` again.
ACTION 2:
```python
bar = qux[...]  # Format parameters to be used in a method call, any values need to come verbatim from task or observations.
# Make only 1 method call per action!
baz = foo(bar, ...)  # Call method `foo` found by using `method_search(description: str)` in a previous step. Store the result in `baz`, which can be used in following actions. Use descriptive variable names.
print(baz)  # Print the result to be shown in the next observation.
```
OBSERVATION 2:
stdout/stderr of running the previous action.
... (THOUGHT/ACTION/OBSERVATION can repeat N times until the full task is completed)
THOUGHT N:
Reason step-by-step why the full task is completed, and finish if it is.
ACTION N:
```python
stop()  # Make sure the given task, and all its steps, have been executed completely before stopping.
```

Extras Instructions:
- Keep actions simple, call only 1 method per action. Don't chain method calls.
- Use descriptive variable names.
- If needed, get current date using `datetime.now()` and current location using `get_user_location() -> dict`.
- Use `print(var)` to print a variable to be shown in the next observation.
- Importing is not allowed! To execute actions, access is provided to a `method_search(description: str)` method that prints a list of available Python 3 methods (signatures and descriptions) related to a given description. Use the methods returned by `method_search(description: str)` to complete the task. These methods don't need to be imported. Pay attention to the method signatures.
- Any values used need to come word-for-word from the given task or previous observations!


Start Executing the task:

TASK: Send a descriptive Discord message with the weather forecast for the next 5 days for my location. Describe the weather each day with an appropriate emoji, include the dates in the message.
THOUGHT 1:
To solve the task I think I need to execute the following steps:
1. Use the weather API to get the forecast for the next 5 days for my location.
2. For each day, create a descriptive sentence with the weather forecast and an appropriate emoji.
3. Include the dates in the message.
4. Compose a Discord message with the forecast and dates.
5. Send the composed Discord message.
Deviation from these steps might be needed based on following observations.
To start out I need to use the provided `method_search(description: str)` method to search for new methods related to "Use the weather API to get the forecast for the next 5 days for my location".
ACTION 1:
```python
method_search("Use the weather API to get the forecast for the next 5 days for my location")
```
OBSERVATION 1:
`get_daily_weather_forecast(latitude: float, longitude: float) -> dict`: Get the daily weather forecast for the next 7 days for the given location (geographical coordinates).
`get_current_weather(latitude: float, longitude: float) -> dict`: Get the current weather for the given location (geographical coordinates).
`get_nasa_astronomy_picture_of_the_day() -> dict`: Get the NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD).
Not all the above methods might be needed. Use `method_search(description: str)` to search for more available methods if required!
THOUGHT 2:
Based on previous observations, `get_daily_weather_forecast(latitude: float, longitude: float) -> dict` seems to be the most useful method to get the forecast for the next 5 days for my location. I need to format the parameters to be used in a method call, and call the method.
ACTION 2:
```python
location = get_user_location()  # Get current location
latitude = location["latitude"]  # Get latitude from location
longitude = location["longitude"]  # Get longitude from location
forecast = get_daily_weather_forecast(latitude, longitude)  # Call method to get the forecast for the next 5 days
print(forecast)  # Print the result to be shown in the next observation
```
OBSERVATION 2:
{'latitude': 50.94, 'longitude': 5.3399997, 'daily_units': {'time': 'iso8601', 'weathercode': 'wmo code', 'temperature_2m_max': '°C', 'temperature_2m_min': '°C', 'precipitation_sum': 'mm'}, 'daily': {'time': ['2023-04-07', '2023-04-08', '2023-04-09', '2023-04-10', '2023-04-11', '2023-04-12', '2023-04-13'], 'weathercode': [61, 3, 45, 61, 95, 80, 3], 'temperature_2m_max': [11.4, 14.1, 15.3, 15.3, 12.5, 11.6, 11.8], 'temperature_2m_min': [6.9, 6.4, 3.9, 6.9, 7.0, 7.0, 5.3], 'precipitation_sum': [2.4, 0.0, 0.0, 2.4, 12.0, 7.2, 0.0], 'description': ['Rain: Slight intensity', 'Overcast', 'Fog', 'Rain: Slight intensity', 'Thunderstorm: Slight or moderate', 'Rain showers: Slight intensity', 'Overcast']}, 'timezone': 'Europe/Brussels [CEST]'}
THOUGHT 3:
Based on previous observations, I have the forecast for the next 5 days for my location. I need to create a descriptive sentence with the weather forecast and an appropriate emoji for each day, and include the dates in the message.
ACTION 3:
```python
weather_emojis = {61: "🌧️", 3: "☁️", 45: "🌫️", 95: "⛈️", 80: "🌦️"}  # Dictionary with weather codes and corresponding emojis
weather_sentences = []  # List to store the weather sentences

for i in range(5):  # Iterate over the next 5 days
    weather_code = forecast["daily"]["weathercode"][i]  # Get the weather code for the current day
    emoji = weather_emojis[weather_code]  # Get the corresponding emoji
    date = forecast["daily"]["time"][i]  # Get the date
    description = forecast["daily"]["description"][i]  # Get the description
    sentence = f"{date}: {description} {emoji}"  # Create the sentence
    weather_sentences.append(sentence)  # Append the sentence to the list

print(weather_sentences)  # Print the result to be shown in the next observation
```
OBSERVATION 3:
['2023-04-07: Rain: Slight intensity 🌧️', '2023-04-08: Overcast ☁️', '2023-04-09: Fog 🌫️', '2023-04-10: Rain: Slight intensity 🌧️', '2023-04-11: Thunderstorm: Slight or moderate ⛈️']
THOUGHT 4:
Based on previous observations, I have the weather sentences for the next 5 days with the corresponding emojis. I need to compose a Discord message with the forecast and dates.
ACTION 4:
```python
message = "Weather forecast for the next 5 days:\n"  # Start the message

for sentence in weather_sentences:  # Iterate over the weather sentences
    message += f"{sentence}\n"  # Append the sentence to the message

print(message)  # Print the result to be shown in the next observation
```
OBSERVATION 4:
Weather forecast for the next 5 days:
2023-04-07: Rain: Slight intensity 🌧️
2023-04-08: Overcast ☁️
2023-04-09: Fog 🌫️
2023-04-10: Rain: Slight intensity 🌧️
2023-04-11: Thunderstorm: Slight or moderate ⛈️
THOUGHT 5:
Based on previous observations, I have the composed Discord message with the forecast and dates. I need to send the composed Discord message.
ACTION 5:
```python
send_discord_message(message)  # Call method to send the composed Discord message
stop()  # Make sure the given task, and all its steps, have been executed completely before stopping.
```
OBSERVATION 5:
ERROR: NameError on line 1: `send_discord_message(message)  # Call method to send the composed Discord message`: name 'send_discord_message' is not defined
Only call available methods and make sure variables are defined!
To find new methods, use the `method_search(description: str)` method in the next action to search for available methods!
THOUGHT 6:
Based on previous observations, `send_discord_message(message)` is not available. I need to use the provided `method_search(description: str)` method to search for new methods related to "Send a Discord message".
ACTION 6:
```python
method_search("Send a Discord message")
```
OBSERVATION 6:
`send_message_discord(msg: str, image: Optional[Image]=None)`: Send a message to discord. An optional image to send can be provided.
`send_slack_message(msg: str, channel_id: str)`: Send a message to the Slack channel with the specified ID.
`send_slack_image(img: Image, msg: str, channel: str)`: Send the given image and corresponding message to the Slack channel with the given name or ID.
THOUGHT 7:
Based on previous observations, `send_message_discord(msg: str, image: Optional[Image]=None)` seems to be the most useful method to send the composed Discord message. I need to call the method.
ACTION 7:
```python
send_message_discord(message)  # Call method to send the composed Discord message
stop()  # Make sure the given task, and all its steps, have been executed completely before stopping.
```
