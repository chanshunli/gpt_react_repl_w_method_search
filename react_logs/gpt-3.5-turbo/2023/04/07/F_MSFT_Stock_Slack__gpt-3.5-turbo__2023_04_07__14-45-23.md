## Initial Prompt
Execute the given task in steps. Use the following dialog format:

TASK: The input task to execute by taking actions step by step.

THOUGHT 1:
Reason step-by-step which action to take next to solve the task. Make sure no steps are forgotten. Use `method_search(description: str)` to find methods to execute each step.

ACTION 1:
```Python
method_search("description_xyzzy")  # Search method to execute next step
```

OBSERVATION 1:
`foo(bar, ...)`: Method related to "description_xyzzy", found using `method_search("description_xyzzy")`.

THOUGHT 2:
Reason if method `foo(bar, ...)` is useful to solve step 1. If not, call `method_search` again.

ACTION 2:
```python
bar = qux[...]  # Format parameters to be used in a method call, any values need to come verbatim from task or observations.
# Make only 1 method call per action!
baz = foo(bar, ...)  # Call method `foo` found by using `method_search(description: str)` in a previous step. Store the result in `baz`, which can be used in following actions. Use descriptive variable names.
print(baz)  # Print the result to be shown in the next observation.
```

OBSERVATION 2:
stdout/stderr of running the previous action.
... (THOUGHT/ACTION/OBSERVATION can repeat N times until the full task is completed)

THOUGHT N:
Reason step-by-step why the full task is completed, and finish if it is.

ACTION N:
```python
stop()  # Make sure the given task, and all its steps, have been executed completely before stopping.
```

Extras Instructions:
- Keep actions simple, call only 1 method per action. Don't chain method calls.
- Use descriptive variable names.
- If needed, get current date using `datetime.now()` and current location using `get_user_location() -> dict`.
- Use `print(var)` to print a variable to be shown in the next observation.
- Importing is not allowed! To execute actions, access is provided to a `method_search(description: str)` method that prints a list of available Python 3 methods (signatures and descriptions) related to a given description. Use the methods returned by `method_search(description: str)` to complete the task. These methods don't need to be imported. Pay attention to the method signatures.
- Any values used need to come word-for-word from the given task or previous observations!


Start Executing the task:

TASK: What week in the last 3 months had the lowest MSFT stock closing price? Send the result including price and date to the #experimenting-with-simple-ai-agents Slack channel.

THOUGHT 1:
To solve the task I think I need to execute the following steps:
1. Use a financial API to get the MSFT stock closing prices for the last 3 months.
2. Identify the lowest closing price from the data obtained in step 1.
3. Find the date of the identified lowest closing price.
4. Compose a message with the identified date and price.
5. Send the composed message to the #experimenting-with-simple-ai-agents Slack channel.
Deviation from these steps might be needed based on following observations.
To start out I need to use the provided `method_search(description: str)` method to search for new methods related to "Use a financial API to get the MSFT stock closing prices for the last 3 months".

ACTION 1:
```python
method_search("Use a financial API to get the MSFT stock closing prices for the last 3 months")
```

OBSERVATION 1:
`get_weekly_stock_price(symbol: str) -> Table`: Get stock prices for the given company ticker symbol aggregated weekly. Financial historical prices returned are over a time period of 20+ years.
`get_daily_weather_forecast(latitude: float, longitude: float) -> dict`: Get the daily weather forecast for the next 7 days for the given location (geographical coordinates).
`get_nasa_astronomy_picture_of_the_day() -> dict`: Get the NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD).
Not all the above methods might be needed. Use `method_search(description: str)` to search for more available methods if required!

## STEP 2 - prompt size = 904
### THOUGHT 2:
Based on previous observations, I need to use the `get_weekly_stock_price(symbol: str) -> Table` method to get the MSFT stock closing prices for the last 3 months. I will format the parameters and call the method to store the result in a variable `stock_prices`.
### ACTION 2:
```python
symbol = "MSFT"
stock_prices = get_weekly_stock_price(symbol)
print(stock_prices)  # Print the result to be shown in the next observation.
```
### OBSERVATION 2:
<Table columns=['timestamp: datetime64[ns]', 'open: float64', 'high: float64', 'low: float64', 'close: float64', 'volume: int64'], len=1222)>

## STEP 3 - prompt size = 1064
### THOUGHT 3:
Based on previous observations, I need to identify the lowest closing price from the `stock_prices` table obtained in the previous step. I will use the `min()` function to find the minimum closing price and store it in a variable `lowest_price`.
### ACTION 3:
```python
lowest_price = min(stock_prices['close'])
print(lowest_price)  # Print the result to be shown in the next observation.
```
### OBSERVATION 3:
ERROR: TableIndexTypeError on line 1: `lowest_price = min(stock_prices['close'])`: Table indexing selects a row by its integer position. The index needs to be an int, got str instead! If needed, use SQL queries via `run_sql_query(table: Table, sql: str) -> Table` to query, filter, select, or sort by, a specific column first!

## STEP 4 - prompt size = 1244
### THOUGHT 4:
Based on previous observations, I need to modify the previous action to select the 'close' column from the `stock_prices` table before using the `min()` function to find the minimum closing price and store it in a variable `lowest_price`.
### ACTION 4:
```python
close_prices = stock_prices['close']
lowest_price = min(close_prices)
print(lowest_price)  # Print the result to be shown in the next observation.
```
### OBSERVATION 4:
ERROR: TableIndexTypeError on line 1: `close_prices = stock_prices['close']`: Table indexing selects a row by its integer position. The index needs to be an int, got str instead!
