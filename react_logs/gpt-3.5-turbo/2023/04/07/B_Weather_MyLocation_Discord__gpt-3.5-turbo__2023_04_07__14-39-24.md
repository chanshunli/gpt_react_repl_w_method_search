Model: gpt-3.5-turbo

## Initial Prompt
Execute the given task in steps. Use the following dialog format:

TASK: The input task to execute by taking actions step by step.

THOUGHT 1:
Reason step-by-step which action to take next to solve the task. Make sure no steps are forgotten. Use `method_search(description: str)` to find methods to execute each step.

ACTION 1:
```Python
method_search("description_xyzzy")  # Search method to execute next step
```

OBSERVATION 1:
`foo(bar, ...)`: Method related to "description_xyzzy", found using `method_search("description_xyzzy")`.

THOUGHT 2:
Reason if method `foo(bar, ...)` is useful to solve step 1. If not, call `method_search` again.

ACTION 2:
```python
bar = qux[...]  # Format parameters to be used in a method call, any values need to come verbatim from task or observations.
# Make only 1 method call per action!
baz = foo(bar, ...)  # Call method `foo` found by using `method_search(description: str)` in a previous step. Store the result in `baz`, which can be used in following actions. Use descriptive variable names.
print(baz)  # Print the result to be shown in the next observation.
```

OBSERVATION 2:
stdout/stderr of running the previous action.
... (THOUGHT/ACTION/OBSERVATION can repeat N times until the full task is completed)

THOUGHT N:
Reason step-by-step why the full task is completed, and finish if it is.

ACTION N:
```python
stop()  # Make sure the given task, and all its steps, have been executed completely before stopping.
```

Extras Instructions:
- Keep actions simple, call only 1 method per action. Don't chain method calls.
- Use descriptive variable names.
- If needed, get current date using `datetime.now()` and current location using `get_user_location() -> dict`.
- Use `print(var)` to print a variable to be shown in the next observation.
- Importing is not allowed! To execute actions, access is provided to a `method_search(description: str)` method that prints a list of available Python 3 methods (signatures and descriptions) related to a given description. Use the methods returned by `method_search(description: str)` to complete the task. These methods don't need to be imported. Pay attention to the method signatures.
- Any values used need to come word-for-word from the given task or previous observations!


Start Executing the task:

TASK: Send a Discord message with the current weather for my location.

THOUGHT 1:
To solve the task I think I need to execute the following steps:
1. Use a weather API to get the current weather for the user's location.
2. Authenticate with the Discord API to send a message.
3. Compose a message with the current weather information.
4. Send the composed message to the user's Discord channel.
Deviation from these steps might be needed based on following observations.
To start out I need to use the provided `method_search(description: str)` method to search for new methods related to "Use a weather API to get the current weather for the user's location".

ACTION 1:
```python
method_search("Use a weather API to get the current weather for the user's location")
```

OBSERVATION 1:
`get_current_weather(latitude: float, longitude: float) -> dict`: Get the current weather for the given location (geographical coordinates).
`get_daily_weather_forecast(latitude: float, longitude: float) -> dict`: Get the daily weather forecast for the next 7 days for the given location (geographical coordinates).
`get_user_location() -> dict`: Return the user's current location.
Not all the above methods might be needed. Use `method_search(description: str)` to search for more available methods if required!

## STEP 2 - prompt size = 818
### THOUGHT 2:
Based on previous observations, I need to use the `get_user_location()` method to get the user's current location, and then use the `get_current_weather(latitude: float, longitude: float) -> dict` method to get the current weather for that location.
### ACTION 2:
```python
user_location = get_user_location()  # Get the user's current location
latitude = user_location['latitude']  # Extract the latitude from the user's location
longitude = user_location['longitude']  # Extract the longitude from the user's location
current_weather = get_current_weather(latitude, longitude)  # Get the current weather for the user's location
print(current_weather)  # Print the current weather to be shown in the next observation
```
### OBSERVATION 2:
{'latitude': 50.94, 'longitude': 5.3399997, 'elevation': 41.0, 'current_weather': {'temperature': 11.4, 'windspeed': 9.9, 'winddirection': 316.0, 'is_day': 1, 'time': '2023-04-07T12:00', 'description': 'Overcast'}, 'timezone': 'GMT [GMT]', 'temperature_unit': 'celsius', 'windspeed_unit': 'kmh', 'winddirection_unit': 'degrees'}

## STEP 3 - prompt size = 1106
### THOUGHT 3:
Based on previous observations, I need to use the Discord API to authenticate and send a message. I will use `method_search(description: str)` to search for available methods related to the Discord API.
### ACTION 3:
```python
method_search("Discord API")
```
### OBSERVATION 3:
`send_message_discord(msg: str, image: Optional[Image]=None)`: Send a message to discord. An optional image to send can be provided.
`send_slack_message(msg: str, channel_id: str)`: Send a message to the Slack channel with the specified ID.
`get_nasa_astronomy_picture_of_the_day() -> dict`: Get the NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD).

## STEP 4 - prompt size = 1262
### THOUGHT 4:
Based on previous observations, I need to use the `send_message_discord(msg: str, image: Optional[Image]=None)` method to send a message to Discord. I will compose the message with the current weather information obtained in the previous step.
### ACTION 4:
```python
message = f"The current weather for your location is {current_weather['current_weather']['description']} with a temperature of {current_weather['current_weather']['temperature']} degrees Celsius and a wind speed of {current_weather['current_weather']['windspeed']} km/h."
send_message_discord(message)  # Send the message to Discord
```
### OBSERVATION 4:
Discord message sent successfully.

## STEP 5 - prompt size = 1408
### THOUGHT 5:
Based on previous observations, the task has been completed successfully. I can stop now.
### ACTION 5:
```python
stop()  # Stop executing the task
```
`stop()` called! Agent finished in 5 steps and 20s.
ReAct Agent has finished the task! `stop()` called by agent.
