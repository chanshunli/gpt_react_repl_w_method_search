## Initial Prompt
Execute the given task in steps. Use the following dialog format:

TASK: The input task to execute by taking actions step by step.

THOUGHT 1:
Reason step-by-step which action to take next to solve the task. Make sure no steps are forgotten. Use `method_search(description: str)` to find methods to execute each step.

ACTION 1:
```Python
method_search("description_xyzzy")  # Search method to execute next step
```

OBSERVATION 1:
`foo(bar, ...)`: Method related to "description_xyzzy", found using `method_search("description_xyzzy")`.

THOUGHT 2:
Reason if method `foo(bar, ...)` is useful to solve step 1. If not, call `method_search` again.

ACTION 2:
```python
bar = qux[...]  # Format parameters to be used in a method call, any values need to come verbatim from task or observations.
# Make only 1 method call per action!
baz = foo(bar, ...)  # Call method `foo` found by using `method_search(description: str)` in a previous step. Store the result in `baz`, which can be used in following actions. Use descriptive variable names.
print(baz)  # Print the result to be shown in the next observation.
```

OBSERVATION 2:
stdout/stderr of running the previous action.
... (THOUGHT/ACTION/OBSERVATION can repeat N times until the full task is completed)

THOUGHT N:
Reason step-by-step why the full task is completed, and finish if it is.

ACTION N:
```python
stop()  # Make sure the given task, and all its steps, have been executed completely before stopping.
```

Extras Instructions:
- Keep actions simple, call only 1 method per action. Don't chain method calls.
- Use descriptive variable names.
- If needed, get current date using `datetime.now()` and current location using `get_user_location() -> dict`.
- Use `print(var)` to print a variable to be shown in the next observation.
- Importing is not allowed! To execute actions, access is provided to a `method_search(description: str)` method that prints a list of available Python 3 methods (signatures and descriptions) related to a given description. Use the methods returned by `method_search(description: str)` to complete the task. These methods don't need to be imported. Pay attention to the method signatures.
- Any values used need to come word-for-word from the given task or previous observations!


Start Executing the task:

TASK: What week in the last 3 months had the lowest MSFT stock closing price? Send the result including price and date to the #experimenting-with-simple-ai-agents Slack channel.

THOUGHT 1:
To solve the task I think I need to execute the following steps:
1. Use the stock API to get the MSFT stock closing prices for the last 3 months.
2. Find the week with the lowest closing price.
3. Compose a message with the week, date, and closing price.
4. Send the composed message to the #experimenting-with-simple-ai-agents Slack channel.
Deviation from these steps might be needed based on following observations.
To start out I need to use the provided `method_search(description: str)` method to search for new methods related to "Use the stock API to get the MSFT stock closing prices for the last 3 months".

ACTION 1:
```python
method_search("Use the stock API to get the MSFT stock closing prices for the last 3 months")
```

OBSERVATION 1:
`get_weekly_stock_price(symbol: str) -> Table`: Get stock prices for the given company ticker symbol aggregated weekly. Financial historical prices returned are over a time period of 20+ years.
`get_daily_weather_forecast(latitude: float, longitude: float) -> dict`: Get the daily weather forecast for the next 7 days for the given location (geographical coordinates).
`get_nasa_astronomy_picture_of_the_day() -> dict`: Get the NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD).
Not all the above methods might be needed. Use `method_search(description: str)` to search for more available methods if required!

## STEP 2 - prompt size = 1023
### THOUGHT 2:
Based on previous observations, `get_weekly_stock_price(symbol: str) -> Table` is the method I need to use to get the MSFT stock closing prices for the last 3 months.
### ACTION 2:
```python
symbol = "MSFT"  # Get the company ticker symbol from the task
weekly_stock_prices = get_weekly_stock_price(symbol)  # Call the method to get the MSFT stock closing prices for the last 3 months
```
### OBSERVATION 2:
Action executed successfully! No output in stdout/stderr. Assign values returned by methods to variables and use `print()` to output them in the next observation!

## STEP 3 - prompt size = 1187
### THOUGHT 3:
Based on previous observations, I need to find the week with the lowest closing price from the `weekly_stock_prices` variable.
### ACTION 3:
```python
lowest_price = float("inf")  # Initialize lowest price to infinity
lowest_price_week = None  # Initialize lowest price week to None

# Iterate over the weekly stock prices
for week, price in weekly_stock_prices.items():
    if price < lowest_price:
        lowest_price = price  # Update lowest price
        lowest_price_week = week  # Update lowest price week

print(lowest_price_week, lowest_price)  # Print the lowest price week and price
```
### OBSERVATION 3:
ERROR: TableAttributeError on line 5: `for week, price in weekly_stock_prices.items():`: `Table.items` does not exist! Only use `Table` as a parameter in other methods.  Use `run_sql_query(table: Table, sql: str) -> Table` to execute a SQL query against the table, e.g. to select a column. Use `get_table_row(table: Table, row: int) -> dict` to select a row.

## STEP 4 - prompt size = 1473
### THOUGHT 4:
