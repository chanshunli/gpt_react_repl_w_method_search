Execute the given task in steps. Use the following dialog format:

TASK: The input task to execute by taking actions step by step.
THOUGHT 1:
Reason step-by-step which action to take next to solve the task. Make sure no steps are forgotten. Use `method_search(description: str)` to find methods to execute each step.
ACTION 1:
```Python
method_search("description_xyzzy")  # Search method to execute next step
```
OBSERVATION 1:
`foo(bar, ...)`: Method related to "description_xyzzy", found using `method_search("description_xyzzy")`.
THOUGHT 2:
Reason if method `foo(bar, ...)` is useful to solve step 1. If not, call `method_search` again.
ACTION 2:
```python
bar = qux[...]  # Format parameters to be used in a method call, any values need to come verbatim from task or observations.
# Make only 1 method call per action!
baz = foo(bar, ...)  # Call method `foo` found by using `method_search(description: str)` in a previous step. Store the result in `baz`, which can be used in following actions. Use descriptive variable names.
print(baz)  # Print the result to be shown in the next observation.
```
OBSERVATION 2:
stdout/stderr of running the previous action.
... (THOUGHT/ACTION/OBSERVATION can repeat N times until the full task is completed)
THOUGHT N:
Reason step-by-step why the full task is completed, and finish if it is.
ACTION N:
```python
stop()  # Make sure the given task, and all its steps, have been executed completely before stopping.
```

Extras Instructions:
- Keep actions simple, call only 1 method per action. Don't chain method calls.
- Use descriptive variable names.
- If needed, get current date using `datetime.now()` and current location using `get_user_location() -> dict`.
- Use `print(var)` to print a variable to be shown in the next observation.
- Importing is not allowed! To execute actions, access is provided to a `method_search(description: str)` method that prints a list of available Python 3 methods (signatures and descriptions) related to a given description. Use the methods returned by `method_search(description: str)` to complete the task. These methods don't need to be imported. Pay attention to the method signatures.
- Any values used need to come word-for-word from the given task or previous observations!


Start Executing the task:

TASK: Lookup the NASA picture-of-the day, resize to half it's size, and send to discord with a message starting with 'Hello from Space!' and providing additional information about the image.
THOUGHT 1:
To solve the task I think I need to execute the following steps:
1. Use the NASA API to get the picture-of-the-day and its additional information.
2. Download the NASA picture-of-the-day.
3. Resize the downloaded picture to half its size.
4. Connect to the Discord API.
5. Compose a message starting with 'Hello from Space!' and include the additional information about the image.
6. Attach the resized picture to the composed message.
7. Send the message with the attached picture to the desired Discord channel.
Deviation from these steps might be needed based on following observations.
To start out I need to use the provided `method_search(description: str)` method to search for new methods related to "Use the NASA API to get the picture-of-the-day and its additional information".
ACTION 1:
```python
method_search("Use the NASA API to get the picture-of-the-day and its additional information")
```
OBSERVATION 1:
`get_nasa_astronomy_picture_of_the_day() -> dict`: Get the NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD).
`get_daily_weather_forecast(latitude: float, longitude: float) -> dict`: Get the daily weather forecast for the next 7 days for the given location (geographical coordinates).
`get_current_weather(latitude: float, longitude: float) -> dict`: Get the current weather for the given location (geographical coordinates).
Not all the above methods might be needed. Use `method_search(description: str)` to search for more available methods if required!
THOUGHT 2:
Based on previous observations, `get_nasa_astronomy_picture_of_the_day() -> dict` seems to be the method I need to get the picture-of-the-day and its additional information. I will call this method and store the result in a variable called `nasa_apod_data`.
ACTION 2:
```python
nasa_apod_data = get_nasa_astronomy_picture_of_the_day()
print(nasa_apod_data)
```
OBSERVATION 2:
{'date': '2023-04-07', 'explanation': "Brilliant, blue, supergiant star Rigel marks the foot of Orion the Hunter in planet Earth's night. Designated Beta Orionis, it's at the center of this remarkably deep and wide field of view.  Rigel's blue color indicates that it is much hotter than its rival supergiant in Orion the yellowish Betelgeuse (Alpha Orionis), though both stars are massive enough to eventually end their days as core collapse supernovae. Some 860 light-years away, Rigel is hotter than the Sun too and extends to about 74 times the solar radius. That's about the size of the orbit of Mercury. In the 10 degree wide frame toward the nebula rich constellation, the Orion Nebula is at the upper left. To the right of Rigel and illuminated by its brilliant blue starlight lies the dusty Witch Head Nebula. Rigel is part of a multiple star system, though its companion stars are much fainter.", 'hdurl': 'https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2304/Rigel_wide.jpg', 'media_type': 'image', 'service_version': 'v1', 'title': 'Rigel Wide', 'url': 'https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2304/Rigel_wide1200.jpg'}
THOUGHT 3:
Based on previous observations, I have the NASA picture-of-the-day information stored in `nasa_apod_data`. Now, I need to download the image. I will use `method_search(description: str)` to search for methods related to "Download the NASA picture-of-the-day".
ACTION 3:
```python
method_search("Download the NASA picture-of-the-day")
```
OBSERVATION 3:

`download_image(url: str) -> Image`: Download the image from the given URL and return as an Image object.
THOUGHT 4:
Based on previous observations, `download_image(url: str) -> Image` seems to be the method I need to download the NASA picture-of-the-day. I will call this method with the `url` from `nasa_apod_data` and store the result in a variable called `nasa_image`.
ACTION 4:
```python
nasa_image_url = nasa_apod_data['url']
nasa_image = download_image(nasa_image_url)
print(nasa_image)
```
OBSERVATION 4:
<Image width=1200, height=801>
THOUGHT 5:
Based on previous observations, I have the NASA picture-of-the-day downloaded as an Image object stored in `nasa_image`. Now, I need to resize the image to half its size. I will use `method_search(description: str)` to search for methods related to "Resize the downloaded picture to half its size".
ACTION 5:
```python
method_search("Resize the downloaded picture to half its size")
```
OBSERVATION 5:
`shrink_image(image: Image, ratio: float) -> Image`: Shrink (resize) the given image by the given ratio.
`download_image(url: str) -> Image`: Download the image from the given URL and return as an Image object.
`get_nasa_astronomy_picture_of_the_day() -> dict`: Get the NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD).
THOUGHT 6:
Based on previous observations, `shrink_image(image: Image, ratio: float) -> Image` seems to be the method I need to resize the downloaded picture to half its size. I will call this method with the `nasa_image` and a ratio of 0.5 and store the result in a variable called `resized_nasa_image`.
ACTION 6:
```python
resized_nasa_image = shrink_image(nasa_image, 0.5)
print(resized_nasa_image)
```
OBSERVATION 6:
<Image width=599, height=400>
THOUGHT 7:
Based on previous observations, I have resized the NASA picture-of-the-day to half its size and stored it in `resized_nasa_image`. Now, I need to connect to the Discord API. I will use `method_search(description: str)` to search for methods related to "Connect to the Discord API".
ACTION 7:
```python
method_search("Connect to the Discord API")
```
OBSERVATION 7:
`send_message_discord(msg: str, image: Optional[Image]=None)`: Send a message to discord. An optional image to send can be provided.
`send_slack_message(msg: str, channel_id: str)`: Send a message to the Slack channel with the specified ID.
`get_nasa_astronomy_picture_of_the_day() -> dict`: Get the NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD).
THOUGHT 8:
Based on previous observations, `send_message_discord(msg: str, image: Optional[Image]=None)` seems to be the method I need to send a message and an image to Discord. Before calling this method, I need to compose a message starting with 'Hello from Space!' and include the additional information about the image. I will use the `title` and `explanation` from `nasa_apod_data` to compose the message.
ACTION 8:
```python
message_title = nasa_apod_data['title']
message_explanation = nasa_apod_data['explanation']
discord_message = f"Hello from Space! {message_title}\n\n{message_explanation}"
print(discord_message)
```
OBSERVATION 8:
Hello from Space! Rigel Wide

Brilliant, blue, supergiant star Rigel marks the foot of Orion the Hunter in planet Earth's night. Designated Beta Orionis, it's at the center of this remarkably deep and wide field of view.  Rigel's blue color indicates that it is much hotter than its rival supergiant in Orion the yellowish Betelgeuse (Alpha Orionis), though both stars are massive enough to eventually end their days as core collapse supernovae. Some 860 light-years away, Rigel is hotter than the Sun too and extends to about 74 times the solar radius. That's about the size of the orbit of Mercury. In the 10 degree wide frame toward the nebula rich constellation, the Orion Nebula is at the upper left. To the right of Rigel and illuminated by its brilliant blue starlight lies the dusty Witch Head Nebula. Rigel is part of a multiple star system, though its companion stars are much fainter.
THOUGHT 9:
Based on previous observations, I have composed the message starting with 'Hello from Space!' and included the additional information about the image. The message is stored in `discord_message`. Now, I will call the `send_message_discord(msg: str, image: Optional[Image]=None)` method with the `discord_message` and the `resized_nasa_image` to send the message and the image to Discord.
ACTION 9:
```python
send_message_discord(discord_message, resized_nasa_image)
```
OBSERVATION 9:
Discord message sent successfully.
THOUGHT 10:
Based on previous observations, I have successfully completed the task by executing the following steps:
1. Used the NASA API to get the picture-of-the-day and its additional information.
2. Downloaded the NASA picture-of-the-day.
3. Resized the downloaded picture to half its size.
4. Connected to the Discord API.
5. Composed a message starting with 'Hello from Space!' and included the additional information about the image.
6. Attached the resized picture to the composed message.
7. Sent the message with the attached picture to the desired Discord channel.

Since the full task is completed, I will now stop.
